                <h2>My Family</h2>
                <p>My family is my greatest source of strength and inspiration. They have always been my backbone, supporting every step and decision I make, especially in pursuing my dreams and academic goals. My friends also play a big role in brightening my days sharing life experiences, discovering new things together, and teaching me the true meaning of friendship and sincerity.</p>
                <p>I come from a simple yet loving and supportive family. My father, Mr. Mohd Arif, is a strict but caring person. He has taught me the true meaning of responsibility, patience, and hard work in achieving success in life. My mother, Mrs. Ngakilah, is a gentle and kind-hearted woman who has always been my biggest source of encouragement, especially during challenging times in my studies and daily life.</p>
                <p>I have six siblings, five sisters and one brother who always bring joy and laughter to our home. They are not only my companions but also my biggest supporters in everything I do. We share a very close bond, and although we sometimes have different opinions, the love between us never fades.</p>
                <p>For me, family is the most precious gift in life. They are always by my side, giving me strength, advice, and unconditional love. Every achievement I have today would not be possible without their prayers and endless support.</p>
